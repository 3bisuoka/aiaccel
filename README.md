A hyperparameter optimization library for [AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI)](https://abci.ai/).
This software solves hyperparameter optimizations related to AI technologies including deep learning and multi-agent simulation.
The software currently supports five optimization algorithms: random search, grid search, sobol sequence, nelder-mead method, and TPE.
